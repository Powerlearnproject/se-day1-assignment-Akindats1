   - OOP revolutionized software development by introducing concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.  
   - Languages such as Smalltalk (1972) and C++ (1983) popularized the OOP paradigm.  
   - It improved code reusability, scalability, and maintainability, making software development more efficient.  

3. The Emergence of Agile Methodology (2001)  
   - The Agile Manifesto was introduced as a response to the limitations of traditional software development models like Waterfall.  
   - Agile emphasized iterative development, customer collaboration, and adaptability to changing requirements.  
   - Frameworks like Scrum and Kanban have since become industry standards, accelerating software delivery.  

These milestones have significantly shaped modern software engineering, improving development efficiency, reliability, and adaptability.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1. Planning – Defines project goals, scope, and feasibility. Identifies risks, resources, and timelines.  

2. Requirement Analysis – Gathers and documents user and system requirements. Ensures clarity and feasibility.  

3. Design – Architects the software structure, including system components, databases, and interfaces.  

4. Implementation (Coding) – Developers write and integrate code based on design specifications.  

5. Testing – Identifies and fixes bugs, ensuring functionality, performance, and security.  

6. Deployment – Releases the software to users, either as a full launch or in phases.  

7. Maintenance – Provides updates, bug fixes, and enhancements based on user feedback.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall and Agile are two popular software development methodologies with distinct approaches.  

Waterfall follows a linear, sequential process where each phase (planning, design, implementation, testing, deployment, maintenance) must be completed before moving to the next. It is well-documented, structured, and predictable, making it suitable for projects with well-defined requirements. However, it lacks flexibility, making changes difficult once development starts.  

Agile, on the other hand, follows an iterative, incremental approach, where work is divided into small cycles (sprints) and continuously refined based on feedback. Agile promotes collaboration, adaptability, and quick deliveries, making it ideal for projects with evolving requirements. However, it requires frequent stakeholder involvement and may lack comprehensive documentation.  

Example scenarios:
Waterfall is ideal for regulated industries like healthcare or aerospace, where requirements are fixed, and compliance is essential.  
Agile is best for software startups or dynamic projects like mobile apps, where user feedback drives ongoing improvements.
